      <p>Hi, my name is Patrick.  I'm originally from San Mateo, California.  For high school, I graduated from Valley Forge Military Academy.  I also attended college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  Having developed lots of experience in customer service, hospitality, and entrepreneurship, I have decided it's time for a career change.  I enrolled in this program to develop the skills to hopefully become a web developer in the near future.

      <br>
      I love music, snowboarding, and sushi.  In addition to having an innate business mindset, I enjoy DJing on weekends and writing music in my free time.  I have been classically trained in clarinet, saxophone, violin, piano, and voice, and have garnered over 20,000 plays on SoundCloud.  In the past, I have held residencies at multiple club venues and produced tracks that have been signed by various record labels.
